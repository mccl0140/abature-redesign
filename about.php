					<p>Dennis Lavoie is a generalist or better known as, a jack-of-all-trades.  He feels content in many different fields including photography, woodwork, construction, design, environmental stewardship, automobile repair, and more.  He has a great passion and respect for the natural world and has begun incorporating that into his work by using reclaimed materials to build and/or restore unique pieces of home decor, furniture, various crafts, and picture frames from reclaimed wood and other materials.  His goal is to give new life to items that would otherwise make their way to landfills.  Dennis feels responsible to give back to the Ottawa community and the environment as both have helped make him who he is today.</p>
					<p>If you are interested in a particular reclaimed item, print, design project, custom wood working piece or just have a question, you can give him a call or send him an email - he will be glad to hear from you!</p>
