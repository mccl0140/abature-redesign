			<h2 class="text-center">How we are different!</h2>
				<p>Our work goes beyond the bottom line.  We are always looking to improve products, services, and ourselves to reduce our impacts, but ultimately: make people happy.  We need to mention that we do not have a storefront location, but that's okay!  We deliver, or we can meet you at an agreed upon place.  Delivery does carry a fee (the fee varies project to project).  For custom project terms, please see terms and policies.</p>

				<p>We don’t think the customer should be asked to donate before or after a sale, but rather we should take the responsibility and give back to the community.  That’s why 5% of every sale made will go towards helping Ottawa’s community.  This includes charities and foundations in and around Ottawa and The Valley. (On occasion we will donate it to a cause that is currently happening.  Such events as the devastating fire in Fort McMurray.)</p>

				<p>***Coming soon a list of charities and foundations you can pick from if you would like to choose.</p>

				<p>All items are sourced locally one way or another and most of our products are uniquely crafted from limited and changing resources.</p>

				<p>You need to feel comfortable before you can talk to anyone about your business.  It's a stressful topic, many decisions to be made, and so many possibilities.  Since this process is so important, we understand that during the process we will take the needed time to help you reach your goals through creative ways.  We feel our job is to help you along with your business and make sure that the end result is what you want and not just what you settled for.</p>

				<p>We believe in a friendly balance between our business and our world, we pride ourselves in our efforts to give back to Ottawa and The Valley. </p>
